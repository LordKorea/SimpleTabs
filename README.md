# SimpleTabs

A minecraft mod adding easy-to-use chat tabs.

Project page: (Pending)

The default minecraft mechanics select a random item from your equipment that has the
enchantment mending when you pickup experience orbs. However, the selected item might
be fully repaired. If this is the case the collected experience is added to your
experience bar and nothing is repaired.

This mod fixes this behavior by only selecting items which need to be repaired.

This mod requires Forge. It was tested with build #2623 for 1.12.2.
